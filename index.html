  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hi, I am Kevin, my major ITM, im in my third year and I have always found computers and coding fascinating! I worked in the truck industry for years and became bored
  and decided to continue my education and passion with computers (I'll be 30 this february), I have a little experience with python, and did some GBA rom hacks with ips patching as a kid and have built
  a few emulation devices with rasberry Pi's. I've seen a few games built on java and even html(one that comes to mind is Crosscode made with HTML5) 
  this class is a step in the direction of that dream/hobby.
